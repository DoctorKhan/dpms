## About Us: The Living Archive & Our Sacred Lineage 📜

**Headline:** We Are Not Alone. We Are Re-membering. 🫂

### Our Mission Thread

"The Dragon Priestess Mermaid School is a planetary re-weaving of the lost arts: temple work, dragon codes, mermaid fluid wisdom, and priestess sovereignty. We are dedicated to awakening, healing, and empowering divine feminine consciousness in its multidimensional expressions, anchoring ancient wisdom into embodied, joyful presence on Earth."

### Our Story (Woven in Mythopoetic Language)

"Long ago, before the veils thickened, the Dragon Priestesses, Mermaid Oracles, and Cosmic Weavers co-created a living temple curriculum, designed to align humanity with the Earth's heart and the stars' song. This wisdom was encoded into crystalline fields, sacred sites, and the very waters of our planetary memory. Now, as the stars align again, this mystery temple is re-activating, guided by those who remember. We approach this as transmission, not merely content, for the wisdom lives in our voice, our dance, and our dreaming." ✨

### The Dragon Priestess Mermaid Oath
*(8 lines, 8 syllables per line, rhyming couplets)*

I rise with flame and tide within,  
My truth, my song, where all begins.  
I vow to walk in breath and light,  
To bless the dark and love the fight.  
Through scales and sea, through myth and bone,  
I build the way, yet stay my own.  
In union's field, I dance and dare—  
A priestess rising everywhere.
